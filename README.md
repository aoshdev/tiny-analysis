### Random bits of analysis

Repository for random bits of analysis. Overview of code below.

### Football points by matchday
*Graphs EPL teams' points by matchday.*

Findings
- Highlights consistency of Liverpool for long stretches of the season, especially from matchday 9 to 27.
- The widening gap between Liverpool and Manchester City.
- Chelsea falling out of the top 2 race after matchday 12 and allowing Manchester United to catch up towards the end of the season.

Improvements
- Changing the coluor of lines in graph to reflect team colours.
- Generating graph for other top European leagues.


### Luck simulation
*Luck, skill, experience and hard work all play a role in our achievements. How much of a role does luck play?*
*Inspired by Veritasium's video 'Is Success Luck or Hard Work?'*

Basis
- 1,000 simulations
- Weighted 5% of total score to luck and 95% to skill
- 18,300 participants and of these choosing 11 winners (figures from NASA's latest astronaut training program)

Findings 
- Winners were both skilled and lucky.
- On average, luck played a large role as the winners had a luck score of 94.84 out of 100 (even though the weighting on this was only 5%).
- Only 1.59 of the 11 that won would have won with skill alone (i.e. removing the luck factor from all participants).
- As the proportion of winners decrease, luck plays an increasingly larger role in who is selected as a winner.
